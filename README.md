#### University Open Day Journey Map: Content and Experience Design

During my summer internship with the University of Leicester’s Career Development Services, I conceived and delivered a journey map from scratch to guide prospective students through the Open Day. I began by researching dozens of undergraduate programmes and speaking with faculty, tutors, career advisors, student societies and committees to understand what visitors needed to know. I planned the content flow, designed templates aligned with the university’s brand, and worked closely with the marketing team to finalise a clear, minimalist layout. After multiple rounds of editing and feedback, I compiled everything onto a single page that included session timings, key locations and curated pathways.

The final journey map, printed and distributed in the Career Hub as well as shared digitally, provided an accessible, user-friendly resource that improved the Open Day experience for every visitor.
