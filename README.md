Medical Biosciences (Genetics) | Science Communication | Medical & Healthcare Content

> *Science is only half the story. The other half is how you say it.*


##  About Me

I am an MSc Medical Biosciences (Genetics) graduate with a strong foundation in **molecular biology, cancer research, and data analysis**, paired with hands-on experience in **medical writing, healthcare content editing, and science communication**.

My work sits at the intersection of **research, communication, and impact**. I translate complex biomedical concepts into content that is **clear, evidence-driven, and accessible** to clinicians, researchers, and the public.



## 🧠 Core Focus Areas

* **Medical & Healthcare Writing**
  Evidence-based articles, condition explainers, patient-facing content

* **Scientific Research & Evaluation**
  Critical appraisal, literature synthesis, translational insight

* **Cancer & Genetics**
  Molecular pathology, targeted therapeutics, radiotherapy side effects

* **Science Communication**
  Public engagement, editorial clarity, educational storytelling

## 🔬 Research Portfolio

### 1. MDM2 Inhibitors in Mature Lymphoid Malignancies

Master’s Dissertation | University of Leicester

**Objective:** Evaluate the efficacy of MDM2 inhibitors (AMG232, ASTX295, Idasanutlin) in cancer cell survival.

**Methods:**

* CellTiter-Glo (CTG) assays
* Comparative drug response analysis
* Data interpretation & statistical validation

**Key Insight:**
ASTX295 demonstrated the strongest reduction in cancer cell viability, highlighting its therapeutic potential.

### 2. Identifying Genes Causing Side-Effects Post-Radiotherapy in Breast Cancer

Year 3 Dissertation | Distinction

**Objective:** Identify genetic contributors to adverse radiotherapy side effects.

**Approach:**

* Bioinformatics-driven gene prioritisation
* Tools: GTEx, LocusZoom, STRING, Cytoscape
* Statistical filtering of 110 genes → Top 5 candidates

**Key Finding:**
Strong association with **circadian rhythm pathways**, reinforcing the importance of treatment timing in precision medicine.

## ✍️ Medical Writing & Editorial Experience

### Healthcare Content Editing

**Klarity Health – Medical Content Intern**

* Edited evidence-based healthcare articles
* Ensured clinical accuracy and clarity
* Simplified complex conditions for patient understanding

**Example Topics:**

* Rare genetic syndromes
* Disease etiology & risk factors
* * Patient-friendly medical explanations

#### Published Medical Articles

Below is a selection of medical articles I reviewed for Klarity Health's Health Library:

#### University Open Day Experiential Map

I designed a minimalistic experiential map for the University of Leicester Open Day, researching numerous undergraduate courses to curate sessions and following the university’s branding guidelines. The map acts as a concise itinerary to help prospective students navigate the campus and discover programs of interest.

- Conducted research on a variety of undergraduate programmes to tailor content to prospective students’ interests.
- Designed a clean, minimalistic layout consistent with University of Leicester branding.
- Included essential information such as session timings and key locations to help visitors navigate the Open Day.
- Provided both digital and printed versions to enhance accessibility.
