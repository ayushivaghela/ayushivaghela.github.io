## 🔬 Research Portfolio

### 1. MDM2 Inhibitors in Mature Lymphoid Malignancies

**Master’s Dissertation | University of Leicester**

**Objective:** Evaluate the efficacy of MDM2 inhibitors (AMG232, ASTX295, Idasanutlin) in cancer cell survival.

**Methods:**

* CellTiter-Glo (CTG) assays
* Comparative drug response analysis
* Data interpretation & statistical validation

**Key Insight:**
ASTX295 demonstrated the strongest reduction in cancer cell viability, highlighting its therapeutic potential.

### 2. Identifying Genes Causing Side-Effects Post-Radiotherapy in Breast Cancer

**Year 3 Dissertation | Distinction**

**Objective:** Identify genetic contributors to adverse radiotherapy side effects.

**Approach:**

* Bioinformatics-driven gene prioritisation
* Tools: GTEx, LocusZoom, STRING, Cytoscape
* Statistical filtering of 110 genes → Top 5 candidates

**Key Finding:**
Strong association with **circadian rhythm pathways**, reinforcing the importance of treatment timing in precision medicine.
