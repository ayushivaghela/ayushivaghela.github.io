## About Me

I am an MSc Medical Biosciences (Genetics) graduate with a strong foundation in molecular biology, cancer research, and data analysis, paired with hands-on experience in medical writing, healthcare content editing, and science communication.

My work sits at the intersection of research, communication, and impact. I translate complex biomedical concepts into content that is clear, evidence-driven, and accessible to clinicians, researchers, and the public.
